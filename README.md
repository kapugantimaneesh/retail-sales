# 📈 Retail Sales Prediction (SVM)

## 🛒 Overview
This project implements a **Retail Sales Prediction** model using a **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** classifier. The dataset consists of historical sales data, which is processed and analyzed to predict future sales trends.

## 🔥 Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, normalization, and feature engineering.
- **Feature Selection:** Identifying key factors influencing sales.
- **SVM Model Training:** Support Vector Machine with linear/RBF kernel.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** RMSE, MAE, and R² Score.
- **Visualization:** Sales trends, seasonal patterns, and model performance plots.

## 📊 Dataset
- The dataset consists of historical sales data from retail stores.
- Can be sourced from **Kaggle** or other retail datasets.
- Data cleaning and transformation are applied before model training.

## 🔧 Dependencies
Ensure you have the following libraries installed:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn seaborn
```

## 🚀 Installation & Usage
1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Retail-Sales-Prediction-SVM.git
cd Retail-Sales-Prediction-SVM
```
2. **Run the script:**
```bash
python train.py
```
3. **Predict future sales:**
```bash
python predict.py --date "2025-06-01"
```

## 🏆 Model Training
- The dataset is split into **training** and **testing** sets.
- Feature extraction and selection are applied to improve model accuracy.
- An **SVM regressor** is trained using the transformed features.
- Hyperparameter tuning (e.g., kernel selection, regularization) is performed for optimization.

## 📈 Results & Performance
- The model is evaluated using RMSE, MAE, and R² score.
- Example output:
  - RMSE: **3.2%**
  - R² Score: **89%**

## 🔮 Future Improvements
- Implement deep learning-based models for better prediction accuracy.
- Optimize feature selection techniques for SVM.
- Extend dataset for better generalization.
